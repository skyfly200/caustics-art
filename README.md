# Cymatic Caustic Caster
A genrative art project to simulate water surface phenomena and the caustics cast by them.

Includes Rain, Sound(Cymatics) and Wind effects as well as mouse interaction.

Randomized settings on each load

Load 3D geometry into the scene to cast caustics on to it.

Options & Traits
 - Scale
 - Polygon Sides
 - X Time
 - Y Time
 - Damping
 - Rain (On/Off)
 - Wind (On/Off)
 - Audio Reactive (On/Off)
 - Mouse Interaction (On/Off)
 - Rain Intensity
 - Wind Intenisty
 - Frequency Response Mapping
 - Random Start
